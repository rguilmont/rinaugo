# RinauGo

RinauGo adds some ADT to Golang, and functional programming capabilities.

The goal is not to transform the language, which is very imperative-oriented, but rather to enjoy some nice FP functions when it can be useful and add safety.

It relies on Generics, so require go > 1.18.

Because of [Nicolas Rinaudo](https://github.com/nrinaudo), colleague and Scala/FP advocate at our company, that doesn't really like golang as a language. That was mainly before the generics, maybe... ðŸ˜‰
